Hi and thanks for being here!

I am a self-taught developer, happily learning more each day. I aim to not only succeed within as a software engineer, but to also marry my training as an educator and artist to my technical abilities as they formulate. 

Working Skills: JavaScript, React JS, CSS, HTML.

I hold a Doctorate in Music Arts from The Butler School of Music at the University of Texas. As a Henry Luce Scholar, I bear teaching experience at Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand, The National University of Singapore, and The University of Illinois Chicago.
